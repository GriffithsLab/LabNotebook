    "\n",
    "I have been inspired to adopt this new format for scientific record-keeping primarily by Carl Boettiger's [impressive efforts](http://www.carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html). The benefits of [Open Notebook Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science) for individual researchers, collaboration networks, and to the scientific community in general are, I think, pretty compelling. Most of my daily work as a computational research scientist involves small-scale problem solving, which in my case is centred around coding for computer simulations and statistical data analysis. Occasionally, (I like to think) I have interesting ideas also. In general, the best thing that could possibly happen to the fruits of this labour is for other people to see them and find them useful. This isn't some kind of wishful head-in-the-clouds altruism: maximizing the transparency of my work to my close collaborators, and to a lesser extent to other peers, reviewers, and to myself in the future, has clear practical benefits, and I stand to be the primary beneficiary. However I would be lying if I said that this is a completely ideology-free exercise. "

In my fields of computational and cognitive neuroscience, where the heat isn't turned up quite as high as in more commercialization-driven fields such as genetics or quantum computing, such concerns seem to me a little OTT. They are nevertheless perfectly valid concerns, particularly for close collaborators - and to my mind these are precisely the people who stand to benefit most from the OpenNotebook approach. "
