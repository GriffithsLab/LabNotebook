[eeg-notebooks](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) is a python-based software library that provides a simple end-to-end platform for conducting cognitive neuroscience experiments using consumer-grade EEG technology. It emerged out of the close relationship between our good friends at NeuroTechX [NeuroTechX](https://neurotechx.com/) and other other good friends at InterAxon (just down the road from CAMH). Using eeg-notebooks together with a standard laptop computer and ~$200 EEG headset such as the Interaxon MUSE, one can conduct high-quality event-related potential (ERP) experiments that traditionally require research-grade equipment costing tens of thousands of dollars.  This opens up the door to a myriad of exciting neuroscience research and education possibilities.

One of these, which we have been closely involved in, is using eeg-notebooks as a vehicle for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education in high-schools. This has been spearheaded in Toronto by the Rotman-Baycrest based initiative [NeuroBRITE](https://www.baycrest.org/Baycrest-Pages/News-Media/News/Research/next-generation-of-cognitive-neuroscientists), and in New York by the [brainwaves](https://wp.nyu.edu/brainwaves/) project.
